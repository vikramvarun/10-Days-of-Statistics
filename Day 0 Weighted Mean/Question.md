Objective 
In the previous challenge, we calculated a mean. In this challenge, we practice calculating a weighted mean. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task 
Given an array, X, of N integers and an array, W, representing the respective weights of X's elements, calculate and print the weighted mean of X's elements. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e., 12.3 format).

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of elements in arrays X and W. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing the respective elements of array X. 
The third line contains N space-separated integers describing the respective elements of array W.

Constraints
5<=N<=50
0<=xi<=100, where xi is the ith element of array X.
0<=wi<=100, where wi is the ith element of array W.

Output Format
Print the weighted mean on a new line. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e.,12.3 format).

Sample Input
5
10 40 30 50 20
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output
32.0

Explanation
We use the  formula to calculate the weighted mean and then print our result to a scale of 1 decimal place (32.0) on a new line.
